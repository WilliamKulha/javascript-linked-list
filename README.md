# _Javascript Linked List_

#### _An implementation of a linked list in javascript. 3/20/2018_

#### By _**William Kulha**_

## Description

_Getting ready for my first super serious coding interview üòé, I realized that I didn't know what half the data structures you're supposed to know are. So I'm going to implement them all as javascript object with useful methods, but also with some methods that're just the algorithms that CTCI asks you to come up with for those data structures as interview questions. This is the implementation of a linked list._

### Use

Import the linked list into the whatever other file you wanna use it in.\
`import {LinkedList} from 'wherever/you/saved/this/file.js'`

When you want to make a new LinkedList just use a good ol' new statement:\
`const myCoolLinkedList = new LinkedList`;

## Methods

So you've made a new linked list. That's awesome! But you know what would be even more awesome? If you add some stuff to it.

You can add to the end using the `.append()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.append(WhatIWannaAppend);`

Or to the beginning using the `.prepend()` method.\ 
`myCoolLinkedList.prepend(WhatIWannaPrepend);`

If you wanna see if it worked, or if your list is still empty use the `.isEmpty()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.isEmpty();` >>> Returns true if there's nothing there.

If you wanna know how long your list is, just use the `.size()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.size();`

If you wanna see if your list is holding a certain value, use the `.contains()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.contains(thingThatMightBeInHere);`

If you wanna take something out of the list, just use the `.remove()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.remove(thingToRemove);`

Maybe you want to spin your list around. You can reverse your linked list with the `.reverse()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.reverse();`

Everybody hates it when duplicates start sneaking up on them. Remove all of 'em from your linked list with the `.removeDuplicates()` method!\
`myCoolLinkedList.removeDuplicates();` >>> Duplicates removed üòé

Maybe you want to see which element is Kth from the end of the list. Well don't worry about that! Just use the `.findKToLast()` method.\
`myCoolLinkedList.findKToLast(howManyFromTheEndWereTalkingHere);`
